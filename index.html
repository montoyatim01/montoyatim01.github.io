          <h3>Behind the Front Page of the Internet</h3>
          <p>
            Reddit.com is the number one social news sharing site in the world,
            nicknamed “The front page of the internet”. They boast over 6 billion page views a month,
            and maintain 174 million unique visitors.
            It takes a lot to maintain and upkeep that kind of viewership.
          </p>

          <p>
            So what kind of system does the front page of the internet run on?
            Between the site’s launch in 2005, and late 2009, the site ran off
            10-15 in-house servers, with a majority of the big data being stored
            with Amazon S3. Due to the rise in popularity of the website, in 2008
            they made the decision to start moving some of their processing to Amazon
            EC2 to free up processing time. They were satisfied enough with the way things
            were working, that they decided to move the entire website over to Amazon EC2, in 2009.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because of the nature of virtual computing in the cloud, websites like Reddit.com
            don’t have to spend a fortune in physical servers and upkeep, as well as having backup servers,
            and servers on reserve for when there is a traffic spike. They can just fire up a new instance
            within minutes to help handle the load, and they only pay for what they use.
          </p>

          <p>
            In August of 2012, Reddit hosted an IAmA with Barack Obama.
            In preparation for the event, they launched 30 server instances to
            help handle the load. During the actual event, the traffic was so
            immense that they had to launch another 30 server instances to further
            help the traffic load. A feat that took a mere 10 minutes to accomplish.
          </p>

          <p>
            As of  2012, the site was running off of 240 EC2 instances,
            with a custom flavor of Ubuntu. They run nginx web server,
            and the back end of the site is coded in Python. They use Amazon
            Cloud Search to fulfill their search queries, and they store logos and thumbnails on S3.
          </p>
